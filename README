## Snake Game (https://snakesaga.netlify.app/)

# Overview
This is a simple snake game implemented in JavaScript. The game allows the player to control a snake using arrow keys and eat food to grow longer. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.

## How to Play
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
The snake will automatically move in the chosen direction.
Eat food (represented by a dot) to grow longer.
Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake itself.
The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
You can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Code Functionality
The JavaScript code (script.js) contains the following functionalities:

# Initialization
Variables Setup: Initializes the game variables such as the snake's initial position, food position, and score.
DOM Elements: Retrieves references to DOM elements such as the game board, score element, and restart button.

# Main Game Loop
 Frame Rendering: Manages the game loop using requestAnimationFrame() to ensure smooth rendering and controls the rate of game updates.
 Speed Control: Allows the player to choose the game speed using a dropdown menu.
# Collision Detection
 Border Collision: Checks for collisions between the snake and the walls of the game board.
 Self-Collision: Detects collisions between different segments of the snake's body.
# Food Consumption
 Food Placement: Handles the logic for randomly placing food on the game board.
 Growth Mechanism: Increases the length of the snake when it eats food and updates the score accordingly.
# Snake Movement
 Direction Control: Updates the direction of the snake based on user input (arrow keys).
 Movement Logic: Calculates the new positions of the snake's segments based on its direction and updates its position on the game board.
# Display
 Rendering: Renders the snake, food, and score on the game board using HTML elements and CSS styles.
 Score Display: Updates the displayed score as the player collects food.
# Issue: # High Score
Storage Interaction: Attempts to save and update the player's high score using local storage.
Currently, there seems to be an issue with the high score functionality. Despite attempts to save and update the high score, it doesn't seem to work as expected.
